| Jump Boost                   | A Jumpshroom doubles their Jump (usually to 30).<br><br>Allies jumping from a Jumpshroom's space gain this bonus as well, stacking between multiple Jumpshroom.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Spore Spam                   | When a Jumpshroom is active, it can jump around for up to 3 days before it dies of starvation. <br><br>During this time, it spreads spores to any adjacent dead creature to start new Jumpshroom growth.<br><br>A Jumpshroom spore takes 3 days to grow into a Jumpshroom. Most spores will get washed off or get eaten before they grow enough to be active. Once fully grown, a Jumpshroom will not start moving until it is disturbed. |

Groups of these pests can often be found in open fields, usually inactive and undisturbed. Due to their bright colors, they are often spotted from a distance and eliminated by novice adventurers looking for a quick buck.

Because they are often avoided in nature, some Jumpshrooms lay dormant for weeks or months, allowing nearby plants to grow uninterrupted. When the plants obscure the Jumpshrooms, they attract herbivores, which trigger them and cause them to attack in the wild.

Jumpshrooms will usually only attack animals and humanoids.

Jumpshrooms and their variants have the unique ability to Ground Pound efficiently, and were the original inspiration for the barbarian Technique of the same name.
