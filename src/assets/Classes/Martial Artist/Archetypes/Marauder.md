**1 - Blast Technique**
[[Recharge]]. This ability can be used in two ways.

*Ranged Technique.* You throw a projectile (Thrown Range), which explodes in a way that mimics a [[Martial Arts]] [[Technique]]. This functions as if you were performing the Technique from that tile, allowing you to do it at a distance and choose its direction more effectively. If a technique requires your continued presence (such as with a Grab), then the target must be adjacent to you by the end of your turn.

*Explosive Fist.* When you perform a Melee Martial Arts Technique, it targets all enemies adjacent to the target if it otherwise wouldn't. 

With either use, you may [[Jump]] as a [[Free Action]].

**1 - Displacement Focus**
Whenever you inflict forced movement, it moves the target 10ft farther. You may also move 10ft, which doesn't count against your total movement for the turn.

**2 - Weave**
You can [[Hide]] and [[Recharge]] with the same [[Swift Action]].

**2 - Concussion**
When you strike a creature with a Blast Technique, your next [[Attack]] against them in the same round leaves them [[Stunned]] (Fort negates).

**4 - Speed Infusion**
[[Standard Action]], [[At-Will]]. 
Grant a touched ally +1 [[AS]] on [[Weapon]] [[Attack|Attacks]] for 10 minutes. Up to 3+[[CHA]] allies can benefit at the same time.
This Buff ends when you are Defeated.

You gain this benefit passively.

**6 - Improved Blast**
Your Ranged Blast Technique can target all enemies adjacent to it if it otherwise wouldn't.

Your Explosive Fist can be used twice in the same [[Attack Action]].

**8 - Smoke Weave**
You can Jump, Hide, and Recharge with the same Swift Action.
You can Hide and Recharge with the free Jump from Blast Technique.
