Mechanics are engineers that put their heart and soul into their gadgets and gizmos, preferring one specific creation that they pilot into battle.

1 - Techniques
You gain 2 Technique Points at level 1, then another point every 2 levels after.
These Technique Points can be used on any tree, though [[Spell|Spells]] require a way to give your Mech the ability to qualify as a [[Staff]] component.

1 - Greatest Creation
Mechanics start off with a specific type of mech, determined by archetype. The variety tends to come from how integrated it is into the mechanics themselves, such as a vehicle they pilot or a suit that augments themselves.

When you are defeated, this mech becomes unusable and requires repairing. This requires a (30-engineering roll) minutes (minimum 1) and appropriate tools. If you ever lose this mech, you can recreate it in (30-engineering roll) days (minimum 1) and 200g of materials like metals and comfy leather seats.

Unless otherwise noted, all class features only function while mounted on/in mech.

**1 - Supercharge**
Mechs have many powerful abilities that require the mechanic to gather power as a [[Free Action]], allowing them to use one of the Supercharge abilities on their next turn. This always has some kind of distinct audio and visual quality, such as revving engines, glowing chassis, or steam erupting from its nooks. You automatically fail [[Stealth]] checks when Supercharging, and creatures get +20 [[Perception]] to notice you when Supercharging.
 
While Supercharging, the Mechanic moves at half speed. They can choose to end the Supercharge and start it again at a later point in their turn to avoid this.

Because Supercharging is an aggressive action that is easily noticed, it will almost always result in combat starting when the action is taken.

You cannot Supercharge and use a Supercharge ability on the same turn. You must alternate turns between Supercharging and using a move that consumes the effect.

**1 - Augment**
Gain 2 augments, one of which uses the charge feature. Augments are customizable features that can give you new abilities, add additional features to your mech's limbs and enhance your physical abilities.

Gain an additional augment each even level.

Some augments have level restrictions denoted by a number in (parenthesis).

2 - Lock On
You can choose a foe within 60 ft of as a [[Swift Action]] to hone in on. Your attacks have [[Seeking]] and +2 [[ACC]] against this foe until you dismisses this ability (a [[Free Action]]). 

You automatically know the position of the creature, even if they turn [[Invisible]] or gain [[Total Cover]]. This ability does not negate cover for the purposes of attacking this foe, but you are still aware of the foe's position until it moves at least 120 ft away from you.

You only Lock On to one creature at a time.
