Using a proxy for your magic, you enforce your will upon the world remotely.

**1 - Conduit Familiar** [[Companion]] [[Conjuration]]
Choose a level 0 Fiend, Celestial, or Fey, or Beast that becomes Tiny and assists you. It is a creature made of magic, bound to an object (usually a book). It gains sentience if it didn't already have it. It can use [[Aid]] to assist you with any skill check.
If this creature dies, you are [[Drained]] 2, and must spend 1 minute to attempt a DC 30 [[Arcana]] check with its bound object to conjure it at 1 HP by your side.
Should the bound object be destroyed or lost, you must make a new one, taking 300g of [[Labor]] using [[Arcana]].

**1 - Familiar Sight** [[Scrying]] 
You can see through your Familiar's senses At-Will, as a Free Action. While using its senses on a given turn, you're shut out of your own, unable to perceive anything around yourself and [[Surprised]].

**1 - To My Side** [[Teleportation]]
You can concentrate for 3 rounds to teleport your Familiar to your side.

**1 - Symbiosis**
As a swift action, your familiar can attach to a creature within 10 feet, gently floating around them at a fixed distance. It acts in tandem with the creature in initiative, using its actions alongside theirs. It is [[Untargetable]] and [[Staggered]] while attached. If the creature it is attached to is defeated, the Familiar is [[Stunned]] for 1 round and detaches. A Familiar can detach as a standard action, popping out in an adjacent space.

While attached, it cannot be detected if the creature it is attached to can't be detected, such as if it is [[Invisible]] or is using [[Stealth]].

A creature can only be subject to one Symbiosis at a time.

**1 - Conduit**
While using Familiar Sight, you can cast spells originating from your Familiar. This takes both your and your Familiar's actions. Despite being your spellcasting, the effect occurs as if it was the Familiar casting it, and as such it benefits from any self-applied effects (such as aura effects, theft effects, or sacrificial costs). Your Familiar can also prepare your [[Passive]] Techniques with your Mana when it rests. Note that it is still your own [[Mana]] and [[Recharge]] - the Familiar does not need to use Recharge for your abilities, you can do that on your own.
