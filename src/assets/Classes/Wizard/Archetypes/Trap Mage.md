A Trap Mage can cast spells before they are needed, weaving lasting triggers into their spells that activate on their own, making them exceptionally terrifying when fighting well-prepared.

**1 - Contingency**
When you cast a spell, you can imbue it with a trigger and logic so that it becomes Contingent, and delay its effect until a specified event occurs. The spell can linger forever without any upkeep from you.
When cast in this way, the spell does nothing at first, and a distinct arcane mark appears around you that can be identified to see which spell it is. 
When you cast the spell, you must create a trigger condition for it. This trigger must be an action or condition that the target of the spell performs or suffers. Contingent spells will persistently check for any valid targets that meet its trigger condition, using you as the origin of the spell.

A trigger's conditions must be specific, and it may only apply to what a potential target does. The trigger may not discriminate between allies and enemies, except when considering yourself against others. For example, you may not say "Cast this spell on an ENEMY that attacks," but you may say "When I attack, cast this spell on me," or "Cast this spell on someone that attacks me," or simply "When someone attacks, cast this spell on them." Triggers use whatever senses you have, and as such cannot detect things that you are normally unable to detect.

You may only have one Contingency active at a time. You can dismiss your Contingency as an [[Instant Action]], harmlessly dispelling it, and you may even dispel it as it is being triggered.

Spells with cast times longer than an Action will still take their full cast time to take effect, starting from the moment they are triggered.

**1 - Gemcraft**
You can place Contingent Spells on gemstones. The stone must be worth at least (Spell tier squared x 1000g). 

While stored in this way, you [[Mana Burn]] for however much the spell would normally take, and this burn remains until you dismiss it or it is triggered/dispelled.

In order for the gem to start checking for triggers, it must be activated. It takes 1 minute of work to activate a stone, after which it floats in the air, unmoving. If it is forcefully moved by an effect, or taken by a creature (a [[Standard Action]]), it is immediately deactivated, and requires another minute of work to activate again.

By investing an amount of [[Labor]] (using [[Arcana]] or a relevant [[Profession]]) equal to the cost of the gem, you may make the Contingent effect persist beyond the first trigger. It will [[Recharge]] when you take the action, and regain its use on a [[Long Rest]] for [[Limited]] abilities.
