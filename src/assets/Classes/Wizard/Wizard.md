The Wizard is the ultimate researcher and strategist at the forefront of a field of magical studies. They develop new methods of using existing spells in unconventional ways, often from the comfort of their own towers. While out in the field, their ability to adapt to any given situation at a moment's notice makes them unpredictable and dangerous opponents, always seeming to have an answer to the opponents.

**1 - Techniques**
You gain 2 [[Technique]] point every odd level. These technique points can be used on any magic Technique path.

You gain full progression in [[Academy]].

**1 - Cutting Edge Research**
Choose a magic Technique tree. This path is the field of magic you specialize in. You get a +8 bonus to [[Arcana]] when dealing with spells of this tree. You gain full progression in this path.

Every even level, you can make some magic happen. You can choose one of the following options, depending on how much effort you are willing to put forth.

*Create a Spell.* You can create your own completely original spell for this spell school. This can be a bit of a daunting task, requiring a degree of trust between game master and player. Once a spell is created, the balancing does not stop there, and should be adjusted as needed to not disrupt the game too much.

*Alter and improve an existing spell.* Have you ever looked at a spell and wished it was just a little bit different? Perhaps you wanted a boneless Bone Shaker spell, or a snow woman instead of a Snow Man. These changes are encouraged to alter not only the flavor text, but also the mechanics. Perhaps our boneless-shaker allows you to create the boneless world you desire, tearing out a creatures skeleton leaving them a clumsy blob person. Perhaps a snow woman is more affectionate preferring to get up close and personal, grabbing creatures and keeping them frosty.
In any case, the power of the altered spell should be slightly better than the original, and should serve a similar type of purpose.
You could also choose to upgrade a lower level spell. Say you thought [[Fire Blast]] wasn't explosive enough. You could make a 5th level version that explodes again at the end of your next turn, forcing creatures who failed the initial save to eat another one without some extra speed or aid from allies.

*Gain +1 [[Mana]].*

**2 - Arcane Discovery** 
Gain an Arcane Discovery. These features are customizable abilities that may alter your spellcasting. Archetypes may come with additional options.
