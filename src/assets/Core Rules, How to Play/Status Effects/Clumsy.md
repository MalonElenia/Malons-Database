Creature takes a stacking penalty to [[Reflex]] and [[AC]] equal to the Clumsy value. Adding new stacks of Shaken gives all stacks the longest duration of all the effects. 

A Clumsy creature cannot ascend using [[Fly|Flight]], or things that function similarly to flight, such as a [[Hover]] Speed.

Clumsy usually wears off after 1 minute out of combat. Can be removed entirely with [[Total Defense]].
