A **Wet** creature gains [[Weakness]] to [[Lightning]] and [[Cold]] [[Damage]] and [[Resistance]] to [[Fire]] Damage. When a Wet creature takes any of these types of damage, the condition ends.

Being Wet is something that can come up often in the environment. Only by being drenched in heavy rain, submerged in water or something similar can one be considered wet to the point where this has a mechanical effect. A creature that is [[Submerged]] in water will instantly become Wet again after taking the relevant damage, but it may take until the end of its turn in heavy rain to become Wet again.

Being Wet ends and prevents [[Ablaze]].
