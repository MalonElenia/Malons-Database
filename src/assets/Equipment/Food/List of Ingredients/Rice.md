**Description**
This white or brown grain is grown in flood plains. While not flavorful or nutritious, its abundance makes it ideal for keeping people fed, used as filler in meals to cook without spending much when there's nothing else. As Food does not spoil once prepared, it is often ideal to combine something with rice to preserve it.
