| Size and Age           | Catgirls range from 3'6 to 6'6 (Small or Medium). They are adults at 1 year of age, and can live for up to 60 years. However, most die before they reach 10 from their dangerous lifestyles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Appearance and Biology | Modern Catgirls usually have mostly-human appearances with feline ears, tail, and facial features, as well as huge claws and fur on their extremities. They range from tall and muscular to small and lithe, but all Catgirls appear thin and flexible. The taller the catgirl, the more muted their colors tend to be, while the smallest ones can be quite colorful.<br><br>Despite the name for their kind, not all Catgirls are female. They are simply called this way due to their feminine appearances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|                        | When the Links first fell, the Catfolk were the most closely integrated into society. From aristocracy to slums, they had already become quite diverse, and humanoids were the most sympathetic to them out of all Links. Many of them were able to escape persecution at first, but those that helped them were caught up in the mess and forced to flee with them.<br><br>The Catfolk of the time were fierce and majestic, boasting the features of the big cats of the time. Despite the strength and agility at their disposal, mere brute force was not enough for them to evade society, and they had to adapt.<br><br>One such adaptation was their spontaneity and unpredictable nature. Even a Human of the time considered them insane, too dangerous to engage with safely, and too willing to do anything to win. The more predictable ones perished. This gave them the edge to survive, resulting in a future of aggressive and terrifying feline creatures, known in modern times as the Catgirl Megafauna. They were characterized by their messy and long hair, height, dark skin, stripes, and musculature. Once they stopped being hunted, some of them branched off and slowly re-integrated with society, resulting in more "civilized-looking" Catgirls. |
|                        | Due to their spontaneous nature, Catgirls do not form strong societies. Many wild Catgirls are barbaric, teaming up only for as long as there is an immediate benefit and taking what they need to live from others. Larger groups will regularly change leaders due to sudden disappearances, and then disband shortly after.<br><br>Catgirls don't normally build or run anything of interest, instead choosing to live in the moment and roam. They do poorly when given schedules and structure. As a result, they hardly have any longstanding culture to show off. Many have trouble speaking beyond the basics of communication, having lived their lives as barbarians or bandits and not spending time among civilization.<br><br>Of the few common cultural traits among Catgirls is their greeting, born from their desires for head pats. They take turns leaning forward and displaying the tops of their heads, allowing the other to groom their heads as a sign of trust. Other humanoid societies incorrectly mistake this gesture as a formal bow, which may cause offense to the Catgirls.                                                                                                                                                                   |
