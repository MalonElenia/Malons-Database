| Size and Age           | Orcs are usually around 6' and weigh 200 lbs, with many being much larger.<br>Orcs are adults by 10 and usually live to be about 15 without indulging in bloodshed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Appearance and Biology | The most telling feature of the orc is the shape of their skull. They have large jaws with an underbite in order to accommodate for their tusks. They also tend to have short pointed ears, and green, grey, or red skin.<br><br>Orcs are much larger than most humanoids, typically being taller and having much higher muscle density. Orcs are very generous with the beatings they give their body, often treating themselves to body and face tattoos, piercings, and scarification. They commonly dress themselves in furs and leathers, or whatever handy material they can harvest from the creatures they hunt. To them, there's no easier way to show off your greatest kill than to wear it on your sleeve. |
| Lifelong Bloodshed     | Orcs are creatures of destruction and violence. They have a physical need to kill other creatures, bathe in their gore, and taste their final breaths. This need is physiological, and is as fundamental to them as food and water are. <br>Orcs start their lives with green skin tones. An Orc that does not kill will slowly wither away, living an average of 15 years before they begin to turn grey.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
