| Appearance and Biology | The most telling feature of the orc is the shape of their skull. They have large jaws with an underbite in order to accommodate for their tusks. They also tend to have short pointed ears, and either green or gray skin. Some orcs that live in desert regions can get a reddish hue to their skin. <br><br>Orcs are much larger than most humanoids, typically being taller and having much higher muscle density. Orcs are very generous with the beatings they give their body, often treating themselves to body and face tattoos, piercings, and scarification. They commonly dress themselves in furs and leathers, or whatever handy material they can harvest from the creatures they hunt. To them, there's no easier way to show off your greatest kill than to wear it on your sleeve. |
