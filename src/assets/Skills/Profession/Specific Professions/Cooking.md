Cooking is a [[Crafting|Craft]] [[Profession]] that uses two or more [[Ingredients]] to make [[Food]]. Having a cook to make use of monster parts during a dungeon dive can be the difference between surviving and thriving.

The ingredients used must be of different categories.

By default, anyone can cook two or three ingredients together to make Food with a DC 10 check. Each additional ingredient beyond the third adds +10 to the DC. 

Beating the DC by increments of 10 improves the outcome. Being [[Proficiency|Proficient]] in Cooking automatically adds one additional improvement.

The basic perks are as follows - 
+10: Food weighs 5 less.
+20: Food takes half as long to eat.
+30: Food heals 5 more.

The default Labor for food is at least 1/8 the final cost.

Cooking requires [[Tools]], as well as water and a source of heat.
