You exude an aura that allows creatures to exist in worlds they are no used to. Every creature that can see you (or sense you) gains the [[Amphibious]] quality, allowing them to comfortably adapt to either land or sea, no matter which they normally prefer. Creatures without a land or swim [[Speed]] get a speed of 30 (before modifications, such as from DEX). It allows all creatures to breathe water and air.

This quality persists for as long as they stay near you, but it does not immediately disappear. The boon persists for [[CL]] minutes after the creature cannot see you.
