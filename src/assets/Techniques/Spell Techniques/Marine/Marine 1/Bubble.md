The target creatures or objects are trapped in a bubble. They cannot interact with the outside world, nor can they affect the bubble. They can [[Teleportation|Teleport]] out of the bubble. The bubble can carry any weight, as long as the object or creatures fit.
Anything inside the bubble is [[Untargetable]] by anything on the outside. The bubble itself can be popped with a single point of pierce damage from the outside.
An unwilling creature can save at the start of its turn to escape the bubble.

As long as there are no unwilling creatures inside of the bubble, you can have it follow your movement. It must be adjacent to you to follow you, and you can Instantly have it cease following you. When it isn't following you, it gently floats in the last spot it was left.
