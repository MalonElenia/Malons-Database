At the start of every turn, become [[Wet]] for one Round. This is a Passive effect.

As a Standard Action, you can transfer your Wet condition to a creature in reach. This ends after one minute if it isn't removed.

This water evaporates after one minute, making it inconvenient or impossible to use as a real water source - however, if sipped directly, it can prevent death from thirst.
