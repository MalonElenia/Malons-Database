When not being directly observed, even for a split second, you can appear in a semi-random precarious position.
The specific circumstances are determined by the DM, and by a [[Luck Check]]. The better the roll compared to DC 10, the better the circumstances.
This ability must be used when a dangerous event is occurring or can occur. For example, if your party is watching bandits from a distance, they may suddenly realize you are missing, and upon closer inspection, are inside one of their cages - or are eating with them and laughing. Whatever the roll, this ability instantly forces the plot to move forward by demanding action.

Once used, you must finish dealing with the current situation before using it again (escaping to safety, defeating the enemies, finishing the conversation etc.).
